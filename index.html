<h1> Welcome to veg and petals kitchen garden </h1>
<p class="large">
Hi, I'm Alice and I'm the owner of "Veg & Petals", a family run business based in Malpas, Cheshire. <br>We grow on around 1/3 of an acre of land and pride ourselves on the fact that we grow with the seasons, to rganic principles. <br>Coming from a catering background we understand the importance of fresh and seasonal produce, and the natural flavours that this can bring to our food. We focus on sustainability and use no dig methods in order to love the land we work on. <br> Our vegetables mainly go to a local, sustainable, plant based restaurant working within a closed loop system. We do, however, have plenty of edible flowers, leaves and herbs for you to enjoy!
